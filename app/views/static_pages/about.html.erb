	<p>Once upon a time, the Kittens of the world saw a need for lightweight, unobnoxious way of staying in touch with the people they meet.  And so they created Tethrball. Tethrball is, quite simply, the easiest way you can collect the people you meet.  </p>

		<p>Using tethrball is easy.  First, you want to create yourself.  Next, go out and meet people.  When they give you their card or email address, simply enter their email into the wee lil' search box.  If the person exists you can collect their card.  If not, they'll be sent an invite to join so that you can collect them.</p>

<p>Unlike just another annoying broadcasting system, tethrball aims to be a personal wall where people you know can post community-related things. Think of it as that wall board next to the restroom in a highly visible location in your local coffee shop. </p>

<p>So, post what it is you want or need to your wall where the people you know can see it and respond. You set the frequency at which you get updates from your tethrball! Now go forth and grow your lifeline.</p>
